      Steam rising from the kettle, sunlight seeping in through the crack of my
      floral shades, my mint green tea timer resting on the kitchen counter, an
      empty bottle sitting next to it, the criss-cross pattern on my gray wool
      socks. Five things I can see. Standing in the kitchen, bleary-eyed and
      groggy, I brush a pile of curls off my forehead, rest my elbow against the
      cold Formica counter, rub the soft flannel of my pajama shirt, and finally
      tap my foot against the terrazo.
