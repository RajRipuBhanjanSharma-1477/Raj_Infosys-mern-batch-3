            JavaScript Notes
=========================================================================
What is javascript?
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is primarily 
used for client-side scripting (programming).
It is used to add interactivity to web pages and is executed by web browsers.
It is also used for server-side programming with technologies like Node.js.

It is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development,
mobile app development, game development, and more.

---------------------------------
Variables in JavaScript
---------------------------------
In JavaScript, a variable is a name given to a value. It is used to store and manipulate
data in a program.
In JS we can declare variables using three keywords
let, const, var.
    Variables declared with let keyword:-
    - can be reassigned
    - cannot be redeclared
    - has block scope
    Variables declared with const keyword:-
    - cannot be reassigned
    - cannot be redeclared
    - has block scope
    Variables declared with var keyword:-
    - can be reassigned
    - can be redeclared
    - has function scope

------------------------------------------
Control statments:
------------------------------------------
Control statements are used to control the flow of a program.
They are used to decide which part of the code to execute and when to stop executing it.
There are three types of control statements in JavaScript:
1. Conditional statements
2. Loops
3. Jump statements

Conditional statments
---------------------------
In JavaScript, a condition statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met
There are three types of condition statements in JavaScript:
1. if statement: It is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
2. if-else statement: It is used to execute a block of code if a condition is false.
3. switch statement: It is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a
variable.

4. If else if ladder
It is used to check multiple conditions and execute a block of code if any of the conditions are true
5. Nested if else
It is used to check multiple conditions and execute a block of code if any of the conditions are true
-------------------------------------
Loops
-------------------------------------
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.
There are three types of loops in JavaScript:
1. for loop: It is used to execute a block of code for a specified number of times
2. while loop: It is used to execute a block of code while a certain condition is true
3. do-while loop: It is used to execute a block of code while a certain condition
is true

while loop:
It is used to execute a block of code while a certain condition is true
It is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times
Syntax: 
    initialisation
    while(condition){
        // code to be executed
        update
    }
    Working of while loop:
    1. The initialisation statement is executed first
    2. The condition is checked
    3. If the condition is true, the code inside the while loop is executed
    4. The update statement is executed
    5. The condition is checked again
    6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until the condition is false
    -------------------------------------
do-while loop
It is used to execute a block of code while a certain condition is true
It is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times
Syntax:
    initialisation;
    do{
        // code to be executed
        update;
    }while(condition);

    Working of do-while loop:
    1. The initialisation statement is executed first
    2. The code inside the do-while loop is executed
    3. The condition is checked
    4. If the condition is true, the code inside the do-while loop is executed again
    5. The update statement is executed
    6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until the condition is false
    -------------------------------------------------

For loop
It is used to execute a block of code for a specified number of times
It is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times
Syntax:
for(initialisation; condition; update){
    // code to be executed
}
Working of for loop
1. The initialisation statement is executed first
2. The condition is checked
3. If the condition is true, the code inside the for loop is executed
4. The update statement is executed
5. The condition is checked again
6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until the condition is false
